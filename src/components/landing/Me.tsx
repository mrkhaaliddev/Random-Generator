        Hi, I'm Manu. I've been building web applications for over 8 years. I've
        worked with startups, small businesses, and large enterprises to build
        and scale their web applications. People call me a "Full Stack" engineer
        but I prefer to call myself a problem solver :){" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        I started Aceternity to help businesses build their web presence,
        providing unique web apps that stand out and scale well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I post relevant web development snippets and tips on my twitter
        and occassionally shitpost
